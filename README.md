# Final project
Repository for final project of intro to python 
My project is the hangman game. It inputs different letters from the user by choosing the words from random from the words document. If the user guessed the wrong letter, one element in the "hang man" board will increase. The game asks the user if they want to regame at the end of the game. 
I coded the game and used the help of internet to find the list of words and used that in the game. 
To run the game, download the word.txt file into a folder and upload it to your coding platform and run the program and enjoy the game.
